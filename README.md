# Cookie Galaxy Server
This repository is part of my final project for CS 6314: Web Programming Languages. I implemented a full-stack web application for an online cookie shop, called Cookie Galaxy. This repository features the back-end for the project, implemented using TypeScript and Express.

I created a custom class-based framework for working with Express controllers and middleware. This framework also comes with a dependency injector for shared services.
